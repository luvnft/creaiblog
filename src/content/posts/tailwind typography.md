# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How It All Began

I became the first person to tokenize a commercial real estate (CRE) property in 2021 - a $33M NFT tethered to actual land. But let me rewind the whole story...

## üå™Ô∏è The COVID Pivot

When lockdowns hit:
- My #1 photo booth business in Atlanta (doing $250k/year for 6+ years) collapsed
- Had to refund $30k+ in deposits
- Our 9,000 sq ft Photo Booth Museum got stuck in permit hell (RIP the 30 backdrops we built)

So I did what any reasonable person would do - taught myself blockchain coding and moved my family to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico to test real-world asset (RWA) tokenization in a market where:
- 90% of deals were still cash-based
- Many locals barely used the internet
- Blockchain sounded like alien technology

## ü§ù Meeting the CRE King of Mexico

By pure coincidence, I connected with Nick Fong - the undisputed CRE heavyweight of Mexico who:
- Was literally taking a Propy blockchain course when we met
- Became my guide to Mexico's wild real estate scene
- Showed me how outdated the system really was

## üíé The $33M Experiment

I found the most expensive CRE listing in Cabo - a $32M parcel of land - and:
1. Tokenized it as a $33M "LUV NFT"
2. Baked the physical deed right into the smart contract
3. Created the world's first hybrid digital/physical CRE asset

**The kicker?** You still had to file traditional paperwork after buying the NFT - proving the system wasn't ready yet.

> *Fun Fact:* That bankruptcy lawyer client I had in 2015 (the one with 300+ rentals) was the one who first told me to buy Bitcoin at $440. He later bought Florida's first tokenized home - full circle moment!*

## üåç What I've Been Up To:
- Speaking at NFT.NYC and universities worldwide
- Helping a Georgia CRE firm scale from $20M to $100M
- Working with cities to tokenize vacant properties

## ü§ñ The AI Angle

# üö® The Cold Hard Truth

The traditional CRE market is collapsing because:
- Valuations are based on vibes, not verifiable data
- International investors are pulling out of US markets
- Big players like Blackrock only want tokenized assets

**The solution?** Tokenized RWAs that:
‚úÖ Prove actual value  
‚úÖ Accept crypto payments  
‚úÖ Attract global money
